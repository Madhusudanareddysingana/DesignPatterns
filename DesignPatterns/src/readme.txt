
Strategy design pattern comes under Behavioral design pattern.
It changes the behavior of a class at run time,As behvior defines in methods we need to chnage
the method that is going to be executed.
We will creating multiple behaviors as our need.
We will create one context object which changes the behavior of a class depends on the strategy.

how to make:
We will create one Interface and provide one default method.
we will provide different functionality in each implemented class specific methods.
we will create the object of reference type interface.class and point it to one of the implemented
classes at run time.
