
Strategy design pattern comes under Behavioral design pattern.
It changes the behavior of a class at run time,As behvior defines in methods we need to chnage
the method that is going to be executed.
We will creating multiple behaviors as our need.
We will create one context object which changes the behavior of a class depends on the strategy.

how to make:
We will create one Interface and provide  default method(s).
we will provide different functionality in each implemented class specific methods.
we will create the one context object of reference type interface.class and point 
it to one of the implemented based on the user input
classes at run time.
